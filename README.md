## Operating Mannual

notebooks for training and inferencing are two dependent file 

1. `Inference_xxxx.ipynb` map to `xxxx.ipynb`
2. Download the repository with the target experimental identity (ID)
3. The experimental identity (ID) is recorded with commit
4. The experimental identity (ID) is auto-generated by weight-and-bias with the form of `xxx-yyy-number`
5. The changes of the training settings are recorded in the commit (training notebook), except for the settings of the original code
6. If the file is not committed with the experimental id, it can be found in file content
7. self-implemented codes and the different version of REGAN, their experimental ID are recorded at: [exp_map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4hkW0qgLdyc0CVnbFz_kTCykXAT-IkXxVix7hCwnRM/edit?usp=sharing)

### REGAN (ours)
1. `GAN.ipynb`: `Inference.ipynb`
2. `GAN.ipynb` with commit `polar-bee-473` is for training; `Inferencing.ipynb` with commit `polar-bee-473` is for inferencing


### RegGAN
Github: [Breaking the Dilemma of Medical Image-to-image Translation](https://github.com/Kid-Liet/Reg-GAN)
1. `RegGAN.ipynb`: `Inference_RegGAN.ipynb`
2. `RegGAN.ipynb` with commit `twilight-night-23` is for training; `Inference_RegGAN.ipynb` with commit `twilight-night-23` is for inferencing

### Unit
 - Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks
 - code was implemented by RegGAN
 
1. `Unit.ipynb`: `Inference_Unit.ipynb`
2. `Unit.ipynb` with commit `usual-paper-7` is for training; `Inference_Unit.ipynb` with commit `usual-paper-7` is for inferencing


### Munit
- Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation
- code was implemented by RegGAN

1. `MUnit.ipynb`: `Inference_MUnit.ipynb`
2. `MUnit.ipynb` with commit `polar-gorge-6` is for training; `Inference_MUnit.ipynb` with commit `polar-gorge-6` is for inferencing


### CycleGAN

#### self-implemented
1. `CycleGAN.ipynb`: `Inference.ipynb`
2. The last ID of self-implemented version is `swept-lake-468` (check the commit history of `CycleGAN.ipynb`)
3. `CycleGAN.ipynb` with commit `swept-lake-468` is for training; `Inference.ipynb` with commit `swept-lake-468` is for inferencing

#### original
1. `CycleGAN.ipynb`: `Inference_CycleGAN.ipynb`
2. `CycleGAN.ipynb` with commit `worthy-plasma-26` is for training; `Inference_CycleGAN.ipynb` with commit `worthy-plasma-26` is for inferencing


### GAN

#### self-implemented
1. `GAN.ipynb`: `Inference.ipynb`
2. check [exp_map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4hkW0qgLdyc0CVnbFz_kTCykXAT-IkXxVix7hCwnRM/edit?usp=sharing), `rural-pine-436` is the one
3. `GAN.ipynb` with commit `rural-pine-436` is for training; `Inference.ipynb` with commit `rural-pine-436` is for inferencing

#### original
1. `GAN_origin.ipynb` or `oGAN.ipynb`: `Inference_oGAN.ipynb` or `Inference_oGan.ipynb`
2. The right mapping can be sure by checking the file commit history

### CycleDeblurGAN
- paper: [Cone-beam CT image quality improvement using Cycle-Deblur consistent adversarial networks (Cycle-Deblur GAN) for chest CT imaging in breast cancer patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80803-2)
1. this is a executable notebook
2. Its inference notebook is just a modified version of `Inference_CycleGAN.ipynb`

### Others

almost useless...

- `unet.ipynb`: `Inference.ipynb`(check the ID with commit history)
- `autoencoder.ipynb`: `Inference.ipynb`(check the ID with commit history)

## Folder

kornia/
- this is the folder with sobel edge operator

codes/
- dataset, augmentation, etc.
